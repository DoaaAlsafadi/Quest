# Quest App

this project has two main files the first one for the 
client_side using AngularJs  ......and the second one for the 
Server_Side using Asp.net core 
I used Split Stack Strategy during build this App,so the client and the server are completly two different app's. 

Client_Side :
there is two pages, one for booking appointment and the secound one tow view your Appointment's 
you can edit , delete and view details for your appointmet

Server_Side :
the server will recieve client requests and save the data in the database.
